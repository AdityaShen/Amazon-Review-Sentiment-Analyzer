This is an Amazon review Sentimment Analyzer - Scrutiny

The product is a web based application which uses machine learning algorithms to help simplify the process of analyzing and generating reports for the companies that want to know what the people think about their product.

On providing an Amazon product link, it analyzes the reviews of the product and classifies it as good/neutral/bad to give the Company a clear picture of how well their product is received by the public. 

We have used Streamlit as a frontend for our product.

We have integrated all our modules with streamlit (Login, Home page, Data extractor, etc)

run 'app.py' to start the execution
